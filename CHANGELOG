- Replaced the simple command input with a textbox featuring basic text editing (no Unicode support though)

v0.3
- Removed the textbox in favor of the old input method (too buggy)
- The "conversation" command now checks if a tweet has already been received in order to reduce the number of API calls

- Fixed some crashes when adding a "not enough arguments for command" warning
- Fixed some Unicode encoding and decoding bugs causing crashes
