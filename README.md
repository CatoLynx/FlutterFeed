#FlutterFeed by Mezgrman

##A CLI Twitter Client for Linux written in Python

For this to work, you need [TweetPony](https://github.com/Mezgrman/TweetPony) and [Urwid](http://excess.org/urwid/).

##Notes
If you want to use TwitLonger or TwExtender, you will need to edit the `flutterfeed_tokens.py` file and insert your API tokens.
You can just ask me on Twitter – `@Mezgrman` – and I will give you the keys as long as you don't share them with others.
