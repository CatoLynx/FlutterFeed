FlutterFeed by Mezgrman
=======================

A CLI Twitter Client for Linux written in Python
------------------------------------------------

For this to work, you need [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) and [Urwid](http://excess.org/urwid/).

First start
-----------

Before the first launch, you will need to create a file called "flutterfeed_tokens.py" with the following content:

	consumer_key = "<your Twitter consumer key>"
	consumer_secret = "<your Twitter consumer secret>"
	twitlonger_application_name = "<your TwitLonger application name>"
	twitlonger_api_key = "<your TwitLonger API key>"
	twextender_api_key = "<your TwExtender API key>"

You can just ask me on Twitter and I will give you the keys as long as you don't share them with others.
